# Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients

Deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPG) is an off-policy learning algorithm for continuous action spaces. It is an extension of deep Q-networks, where the selection of the maximum-value action is approximated using a neural network, rather than computed directly, due to the continuous action space.
